        <h1>Eastern Orthodoxy</h1>
        
        <p> The Eastern Orthodox Church is the ancient Christian church that is firmly rooted in the apostolic tradition. It is made up of a number of autocephalous churches (this meansthey are not subject to an external authority like a bishop from another church). The different churches are divided along national lines: Greek, Russian, Antiochian, etc. There is even a fledgling American church called The OCA, the Orthodox Church in America.</p>
