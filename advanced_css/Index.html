		<p>Eastern Orthodoxy is one of the three major branches of Christianity, alongside Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. It is deeply rooted in the traditions and teachings of the early Christian Church and traces its origins to the apostles. The Eastern Orthodox Church is characterized by its rich liturgical life, commitment to preserving ancient Christian doctrines, and its emphasis on mysticism and the transformative power of divine grace.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
		<p>Eastern Orthodoxy upholds the Nicene Creed, the foundational statement of Christian faith, which affirms belief in the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Church holds to the belief that salvation is achieved through a combination of faith, grace, and works. The Church teaches that humans can experience salvation through union with Christ and transformation into His likeness, a process known as theosis.</p>

	<h3>Key Practices</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Divine Liturgy: The central act of worship, akin to the Catholic Mass, is a Eucharistic service that includes hymns, prayers, and the sacrament of Communion.</li>
			<li>The Sacraments: The Orthodox Church recognizes seven sacraments: Baptism, Chrismation (Confirmation), Eucharist (Holy Communion), Confession, Marriage, Holy Orders, and Unction (Anointing of the Sick).</li>
			<li>Prayer and Fasting: Orthodox Christians observe regular prayer, both private and communal, and adhere to fasting periods throughout the year, particularly during Lent.</li>
			<li>Icons: Orthodox icons are sacred images used in Eastern Christian traditions, created to depict holy figures like Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and angels, serving as windows to the divine. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Church Today</h3>

		<p>The Eastern Orthodox Church is composed of several autocephalous (independent) national churches, including the Russian Orthodox Church, Greek Orthodox Church, and others. While these churches are self-governing, they are united in doctrine, sacraments, and worship.</p>
